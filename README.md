# pic16bproject

### Abstract
In this project, I want to learn about solve]ing PDEs (with a focus on hyperbolic and parabolic equations) using finite difference methods and analyze some particular PDEs with different boundary conditions and initial conditions numerically and visualize the solution. We need to implement the numerical methods in python and visualize the numerical solution. 


### Planned Deliverables

Full success : A Python package that is designed to visualize the solution to some PDES with specified initial and boundary conditions. The PDEs includes 1-dimensional advection equation, diffusion equation, wave equation, poisson equation, and some nonlinear PDEs such as the inviscid Burger's equation and KdV equation.
